       <p>Madara Uchiha (うちはマダラ, Uchiha Madara) was a legendary leader of the Uchiha clan. 
           He founded Konohagakure alongside his rival, Hashirama Senju, with the intention of starting an era of peace. 
           When the two could not agree on how to achieve peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict that ended in Madara's death. 
           He rewrote his death and went into hiding to work on his plans to end world conflicts. 
           Unable to complete them in his natural life stage, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to Obito Uchiha shortly before his actual death. 
           Years later, Madara was revived, and saw his plans thwarted before dying one last time.
