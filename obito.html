       <p>Obito Uchiha (うちはオビト, Uchiha Obito) was a member of the Uchiha clan of Konohagakure. 
           He was believed to have died during the Third Shinobi World War, with his only surviving legacy being the Sharingan he gave to his teammate, Kakashi Hatake. 
           In fact, Obito was saved from death and trained by Madara Uchiha, but the events of the war left Obito disillusioned with the world, and he tried to replace it with a new one.
          Madara Uchiha made Obito Uchiha his successor, giving him the Eye of the Moon Plan. 
          Using the pseudonym Tobi (トビ, Tobi) and Madara Uchiha, Obito manipulated Akatsuki from the shadows to continue his plans, eventually going public with them and, in the process, starting the Fourth World War Shinobi being manipulated by Black Zetsu. 
          During the war, Obito had a change of heart, however, he ended up sacrificing his life to help save the world.
