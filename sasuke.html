       <p>Sasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of the Uchiha clan of Konohagakure, as well as being the current reincarnation of Indra.
        He became a shinobi so that he could someday become strong enough to take revenge on his older brother, Itachi, who had slaughtered his entire clan.
        Initially a member of Team Kakashi from Konoha, Sasuke defected from the village to gain power with Orochimaru, and later also joined Akatsuki, becoming an international criminal in the process.
        He later becomes a key player in ending the Fourth Ninja World War, until he is finally redeemed by his rival and best friend Naruto Uzumaki.
        Sasuke decides to return to Konoha, dedicating his life to helping protect the village and its inhabitants.
